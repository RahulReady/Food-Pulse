It's small and sparsely decorated but the food was AMAZING. We got the beef plate and lamb plate. Both were juicy, full of rich flavors, and fell apart in your mouth. We'll definitely be going back."}, {"rating": "5.0", "review": "Flavorful and fresh food that is generous in portion! I got the combo platter. It is not on the menu for some reason but I called and they do have it.  I also ordered their falafel with hummus.  This is my new go to and obsession!"}, {"rating": "1.0", "review": "I will give ZERO stars to the food. KABABs were dry and overcooked. Please, the animal is dead already. Don't burn it to its second death. The cook needs some lesson in making kababs: You need a 80/20 ratio of meat and fat, else your koobideh's will be dry and tasteless. (2) add chopped parsley, red/green pepper to the koobideh. Revisit your butcher or make your own mince. If you need pointers let me know."}, {"rating": "5.0", "review": "Baba Kabab is a great place for anyone that likes falafels.

The prices are reasonable and the portions are generous."}, {"rating": "4.0", "review": "This place is pretty good! It's definitely more of a mix of an Indian and Arab place instead of being more of an Arab place. The meat platter and falafel were tasty but the different kinds of meat just had the same overall taste, which it would've rated higher on my taste buds if there was some distinctive flavors instead just one."}, {"rating": "5.0", "review": "Good food and great service from the manager."}, {"rating": "5.0", "review": "I was looking for a middle eastern place near my job and got this place.  I got the chicken with rice, salad, grilled jalape\u00f1o with falafel and hummus.  Food was definitely not all middle eastern, it had an Indian twist to it that I loved!   It was pleasantly delicious.  I wasn\u2019t crazy about there hummus, but it was really good lol  it was a lil pricey, but will worth it they are very generous with there food.  Glad I found this place I like Indian food too."}, {"rating": "5.0", "review": "Authentic Mediterranean food Thanks"}, {"rating": "5.0", "review": "They're falafels are AMAZING.

I popped in to say hi and welcome them to the neighborhood.  They came to our door later that day and surprised us with a little sampling of their food.  Falafel, Kebabs, Pitas, Hummus and rice.  Everything was delicious.  Will definitely be coming back for more.  Great to have such nice neighbors.

We were the only customers there. There are four tables in the dining area, three were filthy. The floor was also filthy. When the food arrived it was on styrofoam plates. Only one pita came with the hummus plate. The food was good, but the falafel was a bit salty. I will not return because of the dirty condition of the dining area. They were not busy, so there was no excuse for not cleaning the tables and floor. I also was put off by the use of styrofoam plates. I\u2019m so disappointed because I love falafel and want to support local non-chain restaurants. They need to step up their cleaning game!"}, {"rating": "5.0", "review": "They really have a very delicious kushari"}, {"rating": "5.0", "review": "Both the lamb and falafel plates were excellent.

I ordered food this evening. A mix platter and chicken kebabs. Picked up the food within 35 -40 mins. The good was cold, stale, rice was burnt!! The most tasteless food ever. I\u2019m surprised how is this place even running. The chicken seekh kababs were hard, stale meat and hummus was bitter and HORRIBLE. The salad was watery. I called the restaurant to complain last called UDHAV. Picked up the phone instead of apologizing she kept arguing. She said I can complain where ever I want! Disgusting.. she said the owner SHRIDHAR will call me. Baba kababs is horrible. They ruined our family dinner!
