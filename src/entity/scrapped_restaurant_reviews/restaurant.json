Picked up the food within 35 -40 mins. The good was cold, stale, rice was burnt!! The most tasteless food ever. I\u2019m surprised how is this place even running. The chicken seekh kababs were hard, stale meat and hummus was bitter and HORRIBLE. The salad was watery. I called the restaurant to complain last called UDHAV.

Only one pita came with the hummus plate. The food was good, but the falafel was a bit salty. I will not return because of the dirty condition of the dining area. They were not busy, so there was no excuse for not cleaning the tables and floor. I also was put off by the use of styrofoam plates.
