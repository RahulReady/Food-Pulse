The bread is deliciously chewy towards the center with a nice crunch towards the edges. The dips keep the flavors interesting and have a mild spice here and there\n- Garlic naan comes in 4 pieces and is deliciously garlicky and fresh. The bread was straight out of the oven and into the basket. Would recommend this staple if you\u2019re craving and if you will have enough space for the dosa!\n- Coffee is creamy and delightful! It really hit the spot at the end of the meal. It\u2019s quite strong, so I wouldn\u2019t advise if it\u2019s late in the day and you are sensitive to caffeine\n\nAMBIANCE\n- Decent dining area that\u2019s very clean! The staff wipes down the tables and chairs after every group\n- It can get a bit crowded, but it is a popular space after all!\n- Only downside is there is no AC. There are a few large fans, but if you aren\u2019t one of the tables that are downwind, then you are out of luck!\n\nSERVICE\n- The servers are very friendly, but unfortunately very very busy (and possibly understaffed)!\n- It generally takes time to get seated as they wipe everything down and get set up. You need to be comfortable flagging down waiters for the menu and for water (and clarifying if everyone at the table wants water as well)\n- The food takes a bit of time, but it\u2019s reasonable considering how the dosas are fresh!

Saravana Bhavan is very very prominent in India for its healthy food and its rich taste. On the contrary, this franchise particularly is offering very cheap quality of food.\nWe ordered Idly and vada along with Mysore Bonda . I don't know about the age of the batters but I am confident they are too old!! Both idly and vada tasted sour, which they shouldn't be. The 3 chutneys they offered are all very sour. They are very cold that it seems they were kept in the fridge for so long time. Sambar is okay. Mysore Bonda is of no difference.  The name itself is Mysore Bonda but they offered someother dish which is made of Vada batter.\nDon't even know what these people are making customers to eat. I am afraid that if someone who are new to Indian food tastes this, they don't even like to eat Indian food again. Franchises like these are spoiling the rich heritage of Saravana Bhavan and hence India.\nThe only positive thing is the customer service.
