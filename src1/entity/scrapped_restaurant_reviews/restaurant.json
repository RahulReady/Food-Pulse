They kept passing the phone back and forth between the three of them and then hung up on me. When I called back to get their names so I could let the manager know what happened they hung up on me again. I contacted the owner when this happened. He apologized and acted like he was upset that a customer had been treated so rudely. He said he would send some coupons so that he wouldn't lose our business and that the night crew would be dealt with. He took my name, number, and address. I never received any coupons and I have not been back to this restaurant since this happened. I wasn't only treated rudely by the staff I was lied to by the owner.
