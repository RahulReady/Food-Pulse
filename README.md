# Food-Pulse

**Goal:** Obtain a real time analysis for the top food items (via Google reviews) of a particular restaurant. <br><br>

**Version 1.1** <br>

## Data Pipeline

1. Send the restaurant url to an AWS Lambda function (1).
2. Lambda function 1 opens up a headless browser and scrapes all of the restaurant reviews of the specified url.
3. The scraped reviews are sent to another Lambda function (2) which uses a trained Spacy named-entity recognition model to find all of the food entities and then performs sentiment analysis to find the most "passionately" talked about foods.
4. Lambda function 2 then returns the foods to lambda function 1, which then returns the data back to the extension (pretty simple, right?).

## Software Architecture next steps:

<ul>
<li>Store the reviews in a db, so you can write once and read many to avoid redundancies in lookup.</li>
<li>Look up restaurants for the user to enter from the stored reviews. If it's not available, then perform the live analysis.</li>
<li>Set up an offline batch processing script which mass scrapes restaurants and adds it to a db.</li>
<li>Combine the two lambda functions into one. Will require the use of Lambda layers for Lambda function 1.</li>
</ul>

## Data Science next steps:

<ul>
<li>For people/orgs with a big wallet ($400), <a href="https://prodi.gy/">Prodi.gy</a> seems like a fantastic way to train on more complex food items. Since our budget was a whopping $0, this was a bit of a reach.</li>
<li>Look into many other possible ways to train a more robust model. For example, using <a href="https://spacy.io/universe/project/NeuroNER">NeuroNER</a>.</li>
<li>Attempting to perform sentiment analysis the 'right' way as there is more to it than using TextBlob. </li>
<li>What about edge cases where food entities are referenced in a different sentence? This is where you need to dive into another interesting topic called 'entity linking.'</li>
</ul>
