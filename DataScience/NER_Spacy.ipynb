      "\nthe  <START:food>  burgers <END>  at the sport bowl are \n\nAt lunch, you can get a  <START:food>  burger <END>  fries \n\n <START:food> soda <END>  for eight bucks \n\ni can see some people thinking the  <START:food>  burgers <END>  are too greasy, the grease gives you a delightful contented, weighed down, and fuzzy brained feeling \n\na quick rundown on other items I've tried the  <START:food>  meatball <END>  sub was so so, huge \n\nGo to gino's a mile away if you're craving  <START:food>  meatballs <END>  \n\nthe  <START:food>  patty <END>  melt is just a  <START:food>  burger <END>  on bread, so obviously it rules \n\nthe  <START:food>  pizza <END>  is decent, with a crust that tastes like pizza hut's  <START:food>  deep dish <END>  \n\nthe  <START:food>  fish <END>  fry is a lot of good food for a good price \n\nthe best part about the sport bowl is that if you feel some postprandial guilt for your frenzied ingestion of large amounts of fat and grease, you can pop over to willy west next door to get an organic hippie  <START:food>  smoothie <END>  \n\ngreat burgers, sad  <START:food>  fish <END>  \n\ni ordered the fish, when the food came to the table i saw beautiful hand pattied burgers, hand dipped onion rings, then came my  <START:food>  fish <END>  \n\ntoday we made a second trip i ordered the burger and  <START:food>  onion rings <END>  \n\ni especially recommend the  <START:food>  pizza <END>  you don't expect great  <START:food>  pizza <END>  from a bowling alley, they do a great job \n\ntheir  <START:food>  burgers <END>  are top notch as well \n\nthe kids menu is great my little guy destroyed their mini  <START:food>  corn <END>  dogs \n\nwife had  <START:food>  chicken <END>  and dumplings that tasted like they came out of a can my  <START:food>  steak <END>  was tough and flavorless \n\nHowever, it's come under new ownership and everything has suffered across the  <START:food>  board <END>  \n\nthe bf ordered the fried walleye,and i the  <START:food>  beef <END>  tips moutarde \n\nhis  <START:food>  french onion soup <END>  was decent, my  <START:food>  salad <END>  was lacking \n\ni picked up a piece of  <START:food> beef <END>  with my  <START:food>  fork <END>  and bit down into tender, juicyfat \n\nevery now you get a fatty piece of  <START:food> meat <END>  in a dish \n\nyou know when you get that cheap  <START:food>  meat <END>  that is mostly sinew fat \n\ni pushed the dish off to the side settled for my  <START:food>  potato <END>  \n\ndetailed review our  <START:food>  fish <END>  fry crew decided to give stamm house a try after we'd read good things about it on a fairly well known  <START:food>  fish <END>  fry review website \n\nwe ordered some cheese  <START:food>  curds <END>  the  <START:food>  onion rings <END>  \n\nthe bartender warned us ahead of time that the  <START:food>  curds <END>  were standard from the bag said the rings were hand battered and delicious \n\nthe  <START:food>  curds <END>  were sysco  <START:food>  curds <END>  were not cooked well at all \n\ni don't think the fryer was hot enough, because these  <START:food>  curds <END>  were drenched in grease so much so that we couldn't eat them \n\nthe ranch  <START:food>  dipping sauce <END>  was like water you know what they say about oil and water \n\nWhere those people came from, how they got up there without us noticing remains a mystery our waitress stopped promptly, checked our drinks, took our order fried perch all the way around with  <START:food>  hash browns <END>  on the side \n\ndinner  <START:food>  salads <END>  came first were nice fairly fresh, fairly tasty, and just the right size \n\n <START:food> fish <END>  came out slightly later served family style along with our  <START:food>  hash browns <END>  \n\nfirst bite of the  <START:food>  fish <END>  \n\nno sir, this was the nightmarishly bad  <START:food>  fish <END>  that we all remember from our grade school days you know, the stuff that was about 2 3 days away from being used as feed for the sea lions at the zoo So, we doused it with  <START:food> lemon <END>  gave it go once again, the  <START:food>  fish <END>  was so overpoweringly fishy that we reached for the ketchup \n\nthat helped a bit, it still wasn't an enjoyable  <START:food>  fish <END>  fry \n\nthe  <START:food>  fish <END>  was cooked well too greasy, it was breaded rather than \n\nIf only it weren't so obscenely fishy  <START:food>  hash browns <END>  were tasty fried \n\nSo we came to drink and play, in other words, on a busy friday night, in spite of, because of, the  <START:food>  fish <END>  fry \n\nwe grabbed some stools found ourselves giving up our seats to some lovely ladies who were waiting to be seated for the  <START:food>  fish <END>  fry \n\nAfter bugging the extremely convivial bartender about the history of the place, begging to see the wine cellarslave holding tank in the basement, he tossed his  <START:food>  apron <END>  at someone announced an impromptu tour \n\nthe  <START:food>  fish <END>  was \n\ni would have liked to see a baked option on the  <START:food>  fish <END>  fry \n\nnot the best  <START:food>  fish <END>  i have ever had, above average \n\n4 stars for hardee's it's no culver's by a long shot that thick  <START:food>  burger <END>  was damn tasty \n\nthe  <START:food>  burgers <END>  are really good, the best fast food  <START:food>  burgers <END>  in my opinion the fries are excellent as well \n\noh yeah, you should also stay away from the  <START:food>  chicken <END>  strips \n\nthey got rid of the wood paneling switched to a trendy redblack  <START:food>  color <END>  scheme \n\nAlso, the new fresh  <START:food>  fried chicken <END>  strips introduced are orders of magnitude better than the old ones, which tasted like they had been fried in a factory, microwaved for five seconds before being served \n\nnothing in fast food is ever fresh, these new  <START:food>  chicken <END>  strips do a passable impersonation of it \n\nokay, my review sums it all up in a text that i sent to my boyfriend several hours after eating a frisco  <START:food>  burger <END>  wo tomato, small order of curly fries a small diet coke \n\ni was driving while eating it i kept saying out loud how good the  <START:food>  burger <END>  was \n\n <START:food>  mushroom <END>  and swissyum \n\ngrade c triangle shaped  <START:food>  fish <END>  fillets served on styrofoam plates \n\ni just got the regular burger, it was about 350 the  <START:food>  burgers <END>  looked like the frozen variety, they were kinda tasty, really \n\nit's where the locals go for a  <START:food>  burger <END>  and cheese curds \n\nlimited tap selection, although they have a few interesting items great lakes  <START:food>  ale <END>  esthers best were two that stood out as fun what you'd normally find at a more mainstream location \n\nthey also have daily drink specials we tried the  <START:food>  lemon <END>  smash the whiskey old fashioned \n\nwe tried the famous  <START:food>  chili <END>  meaty, slightly spicy, and delish \n\nwe tried the  <START:food>  vegetable <END>  beef soup hearty, loaded with veggies, the  <START:food>  meat <END>  was tender of good quality \n\nFor our entrees, we went a bit conservative grilled  <START:food>  chicken <END>  salads they were huge and tasty \n\nfresh, fresh, fresh veggies the  <START:food>  tomatoes <END>  were wonderful as were the onions \n\nthe  <START:food>  salad <END>  was definitely an unexpected surprise get it again in a heartbeat \n\nour dining companion ordered some  <START:food>  chicken <END>  strips which he requested be tossed in their hot wings sauce \n\ni can't wait to try a  <START:food>  burger <END>  to enjoy some of their other drink specials \n\nWent there with the family for friday which in wisconsin means  <START:food>  fish <END>  fry \n\n <START:food> fish <END>  was good,  <START:food>  batter <END>  was a little heavy \n\nonly  <START:food>  potato <END>  option was fries \n\nthe  <START:food>  chili <END>  wasn't the best, it was good, the  <START:food>  fish <END>  sandwich was quite good \n\nthat's right, i had  <START:food> chili <END>  a  <START:food>  fish <END>  sandwich, a strange combo \n\nthey make good drinks have a small but respectable selection of  <START:food>  draft beers <END>  that meet the needs of both craft beer lovers miller lite types \n\nthe green is owned by two brothers who are always there, cooking  <START:food> bartending <END>  \n\nfirst and foremost, their  <START:food>  burgers <END>  are incredible that is reason enough to go check it out \n\ni docked it because it has a limited menu with mostly fried food, many healthy dining options, then again i'm not sure why anyone would go there for anything other than a  <START:food>  burger <END>  \n\nit is also definitely a dive, the bathrooms are a little scary, the  <START:food>  burger <END>  ranks right up there with the best in the madison area \n\n <START:food>  sloppy joe <END>  was pretty \n\ndef will go back try  <START:food> burgers <END>  \n\nAfter the hype about their  <START:food>  burgers <END>  i was really looking forward to trying the food here \n\nthe ugh With the all of the acclaim their  <START:food>  burgers <END>  get, you would think that they were doing something special \n\nthe  <START:food>  burgers <END>  are frozen  <START:food> patties <END>  look like they're right from sysco \n\nthe reason that people are probably saying they're so good is because the  <START:food>  patties <END>  aren't cooked within an inch of a briquette \n\nNormally i would say that's a good thing, when you're making me a  <START:food>  burger <END>  from an unknown origin handled by who knows how many peopleneedless to say, medium rare frozen  <START:food>  beef <END>  patty is doesn't amazing  <START:food>  burger <END>  in my book \n\nthere are far too many amazing  <START:food>  hamburgers <END>  on the west side made with real  <START:food>  beef <END>  from local butchers to waste my time with this place \n\nupdate i've spoken with a couple of people that are thinking it may be a  <START:food>  fluke <END>  that i ended up with frozen  <START:food>  patties <END>  the time i was \n\nApparently they have a machine there that they make their  <START:food>  patties <END>  with \n\na total dive the  <START:food>  burgers <END>  are seriously amazing \n\nitalian  <START:food>  beef <END>  \n\nmy all time favorite is their summer  <START:food>  sausage <END>  reubenif you love reubens you cannot go wrong with this jewel \n\nWant a  <START:food>  burger <END>  \n\nkind of like the  <START:food>  snack <END>  bar at a summer camp \n\nhard to

sandwich was overcooked, they charged more money since he got it on a  <START:food>  pretzel <END>  bun instead of the regular  <START:food>  bun <END>  \n\nour  <START:food>  burgers <END>  were unremarkable not that flavorful or moist \n\nthe  <START:food>  buffalo wings <END>  were greasy actually hot when we got them \n\nthey charge extra for everything ranch on the side, cheese on a  <START:food>  burger <END>  everything \n\nyou know i hate to do this i have to agree with vickey m the gritty  <START:food>  burgers <END>  are something of an acquired taste \n\nthey do have good flavor are somewhat messy there are better  <START:food>  burgers <END>  than the gritty \n\ni would stop by again for the gritty  <START:food>  burger <END>  \n\ni recently learned that the gritty  <START:food>  burger <END>  recipe was changed in the 80s sometime \n\nwe did think the  <START:food>  burger <END>  was somewhat different from what we remember \n\nthe old  <START:food>  burger <END>  that everyone loved was way better than the new one \n\nwe think they need to enlarge the place bring back the original  <START:food>  burger <END>  if they still have the recipe \n\ni had suggested the ng because i'd been craving  <START:food>  chicken <END>  tenders all day \n\nIn the past, ng's  <START:food>  chicken <END>  appeared to be hand breaded had a decent dose of pepper in the  <START:food>  breading <END>  to give it some flavor \n\ntonight's offering was a step above cafeteria  <START:food>  chicken <END>  strips \n\nflat, factory breaded, flavorless, all of them with that gross gooey translucent strip of whatever you get in cheap  <START:food>  chicken <END>  \n\nbbq  <START:food>  pulled pork <END>  sandwich \n\n <START:food>  waffle <END>  fries excellentcapital

chips covered in day glo  <START:food>  orange <END>  cheese, jalapeno slices, gray dried out  <START:food>  chicken <END>  pieces \n\ni also had a  <START:food>  burger <END>  as my entree, the  <START:food>  beef <END>  tasted a little funky, like it had been reheated in a  <START:food>  microwave <END>  almost metallic \n\nmy dining partner had a  <START:food>  salad <END>  that she seemed to enjoy, it's hard to mess up a simple green  <START:food>  salad <END>  \n\ndelicious  <START:food>  pork <END>  sandwich with  <START:food> coleslaw <END>  very attentive service at modest prices in a rustic atmosphere \n\nyou get your glass mug filled with beer, soda, or juice with unlimited refills, while also getting a very small  <START:food>  ice cream sundae <END>  at the end \n\nthe  <START:food>  burgers <END>  were very tasty cooked as \n\nshe delights in the free mug of  <START:food>  soda <END>  and balloon \n\nWhen our meals finally arrived, my children discovered that the insides of their  <START:food>  burgers <END>  were very pink \n\nit was scary pink and super soft like raw  <START:food>  hamburger <END>  generally \n\nAs a side my husband's  <START:food>  burger <END>  was to be well done was also pink, though not raw \n\nno one offered a discount, a refund, a free  <START:food>  soda <END>  while we waited, especially not an apology \n\nok, i heard from someone that culver's had cheese  <START:food>  curds <END>  \n\nFor those that don't know what a cheese  <START:food>  curd <END>  is ready this wiki article \n\nSo, when class got out early today, i decided that i needed to hunt for the elusive  <START:food>  curds <END>  \n\nthe  <START:food>  curds <END>  are the traditional curds, they were fried curds, like fried  <START:food>  mozzarella <END>  \n\na nice  <START:food>  snack <END>  not exactly was i was looking for on with the search \n\n5 stars because 1 it's culver's and 2 i refuse to let an la resident weigh down the  <START:food>  supreme <END>  awesomeness that is culver's based on her misunderstanding of cheese  <START:food>  curd <END>  availability \n\nour favorites are concrete shakes, the new  <START:food>  sweet potato <END>  fries, grilled cheese, cheeseburger \n\nthe cheese  <START:food>  curds <END>  are good in theory their deep fried heavenliness will vanquish your  <START:food>  appetite <END>  pretty quickly, and then you won't be able to enjoy your greasy, cheesy, mayo ey  <START:food>  burger <END>  \n\nthe  <START:food>  pork tenderloin sandwich <END>  is \n\nthe  <START:food>  tenderloin <END>  is twice as big as the  <START:food>  bun <END>  that it's served on \n\nthey did manage to improve the layout slightly so that the  <START:food>  soda <END>  dispenser is no longer right in the way of where people are waiting for their to go orders \n\nthe food costs twice that of wend's, mc d's, hardys,  <START:food>  burger <END>  king, and with the doubling of the price it has double of the grease \n\nthey figured if you butter toast the  <START:food>  buns <END>  you can serve stale  <START:food>  bread <END>  know one will know \n\nWorst yet if you order a  <START:food>  sundae <END>  you will get it first while you wait 15 20 minutes for you order to cook \n\nJust in time for you to enjoy you sundae as  <START:food> soup <END>  \n\nWorst yet it is  <START:food>  ice cream <END>  it is \n\na frank'en food knock off of real  <START:food>  ice cream <END>  \n\nwisconsin cheese  <START:food>  soup <END>  \n\nfresh  <START:food>  burgers <END>  the cheese  <START:food>  curds <END>  are melt in your mouth \n\nOf course you have to top the meal off with a  <START:food>  custard <END>  \n\ntheir deluxe  <START:food>  burger <END>  and <START:food>  chocolate frozen custard <END>\n\nchoco frozen  <START:food>  custard <END>  was soo smooth and creamy you won't be able to look at ice cream the same \n\n1000\n"
